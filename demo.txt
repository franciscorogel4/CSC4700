What is your favorite movie?

My favorite movie is interstellar. Great movie and one of the few that I can watch over and over

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

If I could go anywhere for vacation, I would go to Europe and travel for the entire duration to the neighboring countries and go exploring/site seeing. 

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

If I could have any super power, I wish I could have the ability to touch a book and know on an expert level its contents.
